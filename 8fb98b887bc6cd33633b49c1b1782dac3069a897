      "message": "Technically, yes, but it\u0027s trivial. The only codec which invokes this path is AAC and it almost never happens because we use Google\u0027s codec. Adding a condition variable to this one is a little more tricky and doesn\u0027t gain much. The rest of the stuff is in the main loop, this is only on startup. Future work maybe :)",

      "message": "Possibly. There were so many issues with the original code that I had trouble breaking it down. Functionally it was good but the original author hasnt touched it since JB. Remember we did this stuff to just get the n1 shipped :) Getting closer to being a powerful feature now though :)",
